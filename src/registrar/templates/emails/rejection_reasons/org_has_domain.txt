REJECTION REASON
Your domain request was rejected because {{ domain_request.organization_name }} has a .gov domain. Our 
practice is to approve one domain per online service per government organization. We 
evaluate additional requests on a case-by-case basis. You did not provide sufficient 
justification for an additional domain.
