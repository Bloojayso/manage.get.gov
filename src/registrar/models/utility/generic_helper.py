    This class is used to measure execution time for performance profiling.
    __enter__ and __exit__ is used such that you can wrap any code you want
    around a with statement. After this exits, logger.info will print
    the execution time in seconds.

    Note that this class does not account for general randomness as more
    robust libraries do, so there is some tiny amount of latency involved
    in using this, but it is minimal enough that for most applications it is not
    noticable.

    Usage:
    with Timer():
        ...some code
