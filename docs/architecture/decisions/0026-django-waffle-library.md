# 24. Production Release Cadence

Date: 2024-07-06

## Status

Approved

## Context



## Considered Options

**Option 1:** Releasing to stable/staging once a sprint

**Option 2:** Releasing to stable/staging once a week


In both of the above scenarios, the release date would fall on the same day of the week that the sprint starts which is currently a Wednesday. Additionally, in both scenarios the release commits would eventually be tagged with both a staging and stable tag. Furthermore, critical bugs or features would be exempt from these restrictions based on the product owner's discretion.
