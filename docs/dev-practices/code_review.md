# Code Review

After creating a pull request, pull request submitters should:
- Add at least 2 developers as PR reviewers (only 1 will need to approve)
- Message on Slack or in standup to notify the team that a PR is ready for review
- If any model was updated to modify/add/delete columns, run makemigrations and commit the associated migrations file.
